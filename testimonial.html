            <li>I am writing this testimony to express my utmost admiration to this training. I would Like to thank all the staff and teachers in Northern Bukidnon State Collage especially to the collage of Computer studies for giving us the opportunity to experience this training. I would say that they help us a lot. We all know that computer is important tool in every profession specially in us teachers, so almost everyone can benefit by knowing how they work and how to use them. In this training you will learn the basic of computer hardware, software and networking. They also teach as the basic skills in using windows and Microsoft Office, and for creating your own web page.

                The thing that I personally learned during this training is, about hardware and software, troubleshooting basic problem of the computer, creating charts, spreadsheet application, applying arithmetic formula and function of spreadsheet, logical and arithmetic function, Microsoft power point, creating multimedia presentation, creating simple web page, understand the error value. I am honestly saying that in my first time I enter the computer room, I am not that good in computer. But know I can say that I have learned a lot in this training. 
                
                This training was very fun and you will learn a lot. I love spending my time learning about computers with my co teacher and helping each other if the other one needs help. All the staff are very friendly and accommodating, they did not discriminate as. They facilitate as if we have something to ask or if we have some question. I love the way teachers teach us its so fun, and hands on in all our activity.  Thank you so much sir/maâ€™am for all your effort teaching and facilitating as. We will never forgot all we have learned in this training. Thank you again and God bless you.
